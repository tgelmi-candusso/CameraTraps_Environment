# CameraTraps_Environment
Model to create the buffers around camera traps of a defined radius and extract environmental covariates., without statistical bias introduced by flooded areas. This model eliminates the flooded areas around the camera trap from the statistical quantification of the surrounding environment. This is especially important for cameras along coastal lines when using percentage surface area covered by covariates or mean/median values of raster layers. The model also provides the option of estimating mean or median population density of surrounding residential areas, without the bias introduced by the size of the green area where the camera is located. The model provides the option to change the radius of the buffer in metres, to any size and to decide whether to estimate the mean or the median of the covariates value, it can use both polygon or raster. In summary, consider this the starter code for running your own analysis for your study site, there is code for estimating percentage area, estimating statistical  value of the raster, to eliminate bias created by water and to eliminate bias created by the size of the green patch where the camera is located, and to join all this in one table.
